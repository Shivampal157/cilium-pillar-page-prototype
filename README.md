# 📚 Cilium Pillar Pages Prototype

> *LFX Mentorship 2026 (Term 1) Proposal Prototype*
> *Applicant:* Shivam Pal (@Shivampal157)

This repository serves as a *proof-of-concept* for the "Cilium Project Pillar Pages" mentorship proposal. It demonstrates my strategy to transform scattered technical references into high-level, SEO-optimized architectural guides.

## 🎯 The "Curious to Installed" Strategy

My goal is to guide users from a search query (e.g., "Why Cilium?") to a successful installation by bridging the gap between high-level concepts and low-level implementation.

### 🔴 BEFORE (Current State)
Currently, a user searching for "Cilium Network Policies" lands on API references or generic setups.
* *Problem:* High cognitive load for decision-makers (CTOs/Architects).
* *Visuals:* Mostly text, few high-level architectural diagrams.
* *User Feeling:* Overwhelmed.

### 🟢 AFTER (Proposed Pillar Page)
The new Pillar Page acts as a *Knowledge Hub*.
* *Solution:* Conceptual "Problem-Solution" structure (The "Why" before the "How").
* *Visuals:* Integrated architectural diagrams using *Mermaid.js* (Docs-as-Code).
* *User Feeling:* Educated, confident, and ready to install.

## 🛠️ Visual Engineering Prototype
I plan to use *Mermaid.js* and *Excalidraw* to create maintainable diagrams directly within the documentation.
